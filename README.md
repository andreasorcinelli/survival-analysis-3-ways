This repo contains code and slides about survival analyses. Survival analyses are a collection of approaches for appropriately addressing censored data - or data for which the timing of critical events is unknown. 

I present 3 ways to implement survival analyses in R: 
 - using the survival package 
 - using a Tidy Models extension package - censored
 - using bespoke functions designed to get an intuition for how the methods work
